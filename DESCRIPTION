Version: 0.1.0
Author: Sungtaek Son
Maintainer: The package maintainer <sst91@uw.edu>
Description: This R package consists of two functions that perform
    two different computations.
    The first function clr performs centered log ratio transformation with the
    input vector of numeric values.
    The log_summed_exps performs the log sum of exponential terms in an
    alternative way in which ordered quantities are used.
